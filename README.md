# Frontend Mentor - Product List with Cart Solution

This is my solution to the [Product list with cart challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). The challenge helped me improve my DOM manipulation skills and learn how to create interactive modals and button interactions using JavaScript.
